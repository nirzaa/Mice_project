PLUMED: Finished setup
PLUMED: Action FAKE
PLUMED:   with label enthalpyPerAtom
PLUMED: Action FAKE
PLUMED:   with label s2
PLUMED: Action FUNCSUMHILLS
PLUMED:   with label @2
PLUMED:   with arguments enthalpyPerAtom s2
PLUMED:   Output format is %14.9f
PLUMED:   hillsfile  : ../HILLS
PLUMED:    
PLUMED:   No boundaries defined: need to do a prescreening of hills 
PLUMED:   doing serialread 
PLUMED:   opening file ../HILLS
PLUMED:   closing file ../HILLS
PLUMED:   now total 1 kernels 
PLUMED:   final chunk: now with 1 kernels  
PLUMED:   found boundaries from hillsfile: 
PLUMED:   found nbins in input, this overrides the automatic choice 
PLUMED:   variable enthalpyPerAtom min: -302.325 max: -300.204 nbin: 200
PLUMED:   variable s2 min: -2.83609 max: -2.12899 nbin: 200
PLUMED:   done!
PLUMED:    
PLUMED:   Doing integration slices every 1000 kernels
PLUMED:   mintozero: bias/histogram will be translated to have the minimum value equal to zero
PLUMED:   output file for fes/bias  is :  fes_
